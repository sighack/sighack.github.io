Color is a pretty vast subject and can get very complex really fast. I'm
going to take a bottom-up approach to generating colors procedurally and
incorporating them into artwork.

Specifically, in this post we're going to understand the various levers
available to us with regard to color that allow us to generate color
variations of a base color.

If you're a generative artist or generally interested in creating procedural
content, my hope is that at the end of this post, you have some more choices
available to you instead of being stuck using random RGB values.

## Complementary Pairs
<a name="complementary-pairs"></a>

We now start looking at generating color harmonies, that is, not just variations
of one color, but different colors that work well together.
The first approach we're going to look at is to _create complementary
color pairs_. Since the hue component in the HSB color space is an angle on the color
wheel, we can simply flip it by 180&deg; to get the complementary color.

Here is a generator for random pairs of complementary colors at a specified
saturation and brightness.

```java
/* Find the complementary color in HSB space */
color complementary(color c) {
  /* Find the angle opposite to that of input color */
  float angle = (hue(c) + 180) % 360;
  /* Saturation and brightness stay the same */
  return color(angle, saturation(c), brightness(c));
}

/*
 * Generate a random pair of complementary colors
 * at a specified saturation and brightness level.
 */
color[] complementary_pairs(float s, float b) {
  /* Pick a random hue angle to start with */
  float angle1 = random(360);
  /* Generate the pair */
  color[] pair = new color[2];
  pair[0] = color(angle1, s, b);
  pair[1] = complementary(pair[0]);

  return pair;
}
```

The saturation and brightness controls are identical to those of the HSB
color space. Here are some example pairs generated with
varying saturation levels.

And here are some generated by varying the brightness levels. Note that things
get really dark really fast, so unless you want to create variations close to black,
you'll want to stick to the higher end of the brighness spectrum.
