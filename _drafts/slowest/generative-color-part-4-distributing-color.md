Color is a pretty vast subject and can get very complex really fast. I'm
going to take a bottom-up approach to generating colors procedurally and
incorporating them into artwork.

Specifically, in this post we're going to understand the various levers
available to us with regard to color that allow us to generate color
variations of a base color.

If you're a generative artist or generally interested in creating procedural
content, my hope is that at the end of this post, you have some more choices
available to you instead of being stuck using random RGB values.
