Hi folks,

My name is Manohar Vanga and I joined FounderCafe a while back with the hopes of starting a solopreneur business. Unfortunately, due to visa restriction and issues related to my employment contract that come from living and working abroad (I'm an Indian currently finishing up my PhD in Germany), I was forced to push back my efforts. Any code I write technically belongs to my university and I didn't want to risk my business on that.

Since I couldn't write any product code without risking issues with my employer, I started writing a blog earlier this year instead (https://sighack.com/). It has become something of a labor of love, and I've been keeping at it through the course of this year. It has led to a bit of sustained organic traffic (~1K visits per month), around a hundred mailing list members, and another hundred or so Twitter followers. I've also been a moderator on the subreddit for generative art since I was invited earlier this year.

My original intent was to create a product business of selling dropshipped art prints, but I'm a little concerned that I might be jumping into the deep end of the pool. I have no experience running a business and I worry that I would be having to deal with too much stuff at once by going after a B2C market selling physical products. I'm wondering if I should back off and start with a stairstep-style approach and sell an info product instead. If you saw my blog, it's mostly teaching programming concepts pertaining to generative and procedural art, and I suspect it would play well with my audience. In particular, I do deep dives into topics that are not found anywhere else and like to teach things in a way that is understandable to novice coders.

However, my biggest worry is that with a few hundred users, I won't have enough of a market to sustain the initial bootstrapping pains. Does anyone have any advice on how I can expand my reach in the coming months?

My strategy so far has been very low key: I write articles and just create a post on the /r/generative subreddit, and sometimes post to Twitter with some related hash tags. Does anyone here have any ideas on how I can ramp this up without coming off as too pushy?

Second, if I was to focus on a self-published book of some kind, does it make sense to start building landing pages for it for SEO purposes and start collecting email addresses? It seems like having a lot of landing pages with copy targeting different segments of my audience (e.g., novices with no coding experience vs. strong coders looking to get into generative art) would work well in the long run towards getting some search engine traffic.

Finally, are there any other strategies that anyone here has had success with for an ebook? I guess I'm mostly looking for longer-term approaches to getting organic traffic rather than short-term tricks to getting a launch list.
